The data recorded from the pair of sensors on the sensor station located at every 2km on the Autobahn in Germany. The goal of this project is to Forecast the Traffic congestions on the autobahn considering the subset of data for 4 months.

Model is estimated using Random forest algorithm, LSTM Deeplearning algorithm. The accuracy of the prediction 82% from F1 Score.
